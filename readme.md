# Personal Portfolio Website – Based on Escape Velocity by HTML5 UP
This is a personal portfolio website built using the Escape Velocity template by HTML5 UP. The template features a clean, spacious, and responsive design with a minimalistic flair. I used it to showcase my curriculum vitae and various computer-related projects.
